          Our story
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
          Budgeting has been a key driver in achieving our financial goals! A
          good budget gave us visibility of where our money was going which
          helped us set targets, and smash them! I got bored one day and tried
          to build an app that would help me budget easily! Moving away from
          writing it on paper and becoming eco-friendly, it is only right to
          store our budget info on the web.

        <Typography variant="subtitle2" gutterBottom>
          The goal is to enter your total pay, frequency, expenses, and then hit
          calculate to see how much $$ you are left with. From there you can
          then save the budget as a pdf. Refer to the below video on the proper
          way to use this app.
